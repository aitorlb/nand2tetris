# Project 1

## Objective

Build the following logic gates:
- Nand (given)
- Not
- And
- Or
- Xor
- Mux
- DMux
- Not16
- And16
- Or16
- Mux16
- Or8Way
- Mux4Way16
- Mux8Way16
- DMux4Way
- DMux8Way

The only building blocks that you can use are primitive Nand gates and the composite gates that you will gradually build on top of them. Since Nand is considered primitive, there is no need to implement it.

## Contract

When loaded into the hardware simulator, your chip design (modified `.hdl` program), tested on the supplied `.tst` file, should produce the outputs listed in the supplied `.cmp` file. If the actual outputs generated by the simulator disagree with the desired outputs, the simulator will stop the simulation and produce an error message.

Example:

```bash
$ tools/HardwareSimulator.sh projects/01/Not.tst
End of script - Comparison ended successfull
```

```bash
$ tools/HardwareSimulator.sh projects/01/Not.tst
Comparison failure at line 5
```
